# Pesto's MIDI Casio MT-40

Loaded recorded audio samples from some analog Casio keyboards into a JUCE plug-in to be able to use it's preset sounds as a VST with MIDI compatibility. For now it gathers samples from models MT-40, RAPMAN, SA-10 and SK-1. 

## Building

Both /Builds and /JuceLibraryCode folders are ignored but it is my understanding that if you have the Projucer tool installed and run the .jucer file those will be automatically generated.
